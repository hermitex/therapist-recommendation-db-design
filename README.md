### **Automated Matching Algorithm**

The automated matching algorithm will draw data from multiple tables to match clients with therapists based on their preferences and needs. Here’s the design we envision:

#### **Key Steps for Matching Algorithm**

1. **Client Inputs**: Collect client preferences on gender, age, specialization, language, insurance coverage, session type (in-person/telehealth), appointment availability, etc.

2. **Database Queries**:
   - **Therapist Availability**: Query the **Therapist_Availability** and **Availability** tables to ensure the therapist is available at the desired time or has capacity (i.e., isn't fully booked).
   - **Demographic Preferences**: Match therapist demographic information in the **Demographics** and **Languages_Spoken** tables with the client's preferences (e.g., language preference, gender preference).
   - **Specialization Matching**: Use the **Specializations** table to ensure the therapist specializes in the area the client is seeking (e.g., anxiety, depression, trauma).
   - **Therapeutic Approach Matching**: Look into the **Therapeutic_Approach** table to see if the therapist uses a modality or approach the client prefers (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Psychodynamic therapy).
   - **Insurance Matching**: Cross-check the **Insurance_Coverage** table to verify that the therapist accepts the client’s insurance provider.
   - **Location Matching**: Use the **Therapist_Location** table to match clients based on location preferences (e.g., therapists available in a specific city or offering telehealth).
   - **Session Rate and Discounts**: Match financial preferences based on the **Therapy_Logistics** and **Promo_Discounts** tables for session affordability.

3. **Scoring System**:
   - Implement a **scoring system** to rank therapists based on how well they match client criteria. For example, each matched criterion (e.g., gender, specialization, availability, insurance) could is assigned a weight, and therapists will be ranked based on their total score.
   - A matching threshold where only therapists with a score above a certain value (e.g., 80%) are shown to the client.

4. **Filter and Sort**:
   - **Filters**: Clients to filter therapists by criteria like availability, price, and distance (if location-based).
   - **Sort**: Present the results to clients based on the matching score or specific criteria like the lowest cost, highest rating, or closest availability.
